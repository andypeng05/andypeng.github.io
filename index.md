Hi there! Welcome to my home page. 

I'm Zhiyuan; my friends call me Paul.

I am currently a CS Ph.D. student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), advised by professor [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/). I am interested in reinforcement learning and building autonomous intelligent agents.
I recently graduated magna cum laude from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) with an Sc.B. in Applied Math and Computer Science, and I was fortunate to be advised by professors [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) and [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com) at Brown. Check out my [research page](/research/) for more information.

Outside of this, I like to jam on my guitar, play badminton, and watch standups and movies.

I love connecting with people. If you'd like to get in contact with me, please reach out at [zhiyuan_zhou at berkeley dot edu].
